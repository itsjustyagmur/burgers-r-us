# burgers-r-us

In this assignment, I creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

Burgers-R-us! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* my app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
